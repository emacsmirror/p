# The Emacsmirror

The Emacsmirror is a growing collection of Emacs Lisp packages.  All
mirrored packages are available as Git repositories.  In most cases
this is done by mirroring the upstream Git repository, but if upstream
uses something else, then the mirror nevertheless makes the package
available as a Git repository.

For more information about the Emacsmirror, please see the
[Emacsmirror homepage][Emacsmirror].

## This repository

The purpose of this repository is to give users a public place to
ask questions and make suggestions about the Emacsmirror as a whole
or about packages that are not being mirrored.  For packages that
are mirrored, please use their repositories. Note that we usually
reject pull-requests because they should be opened against the
packages' upstream repositories.

The name of this repository has no deeper meaning.  It's short and
unlikely to be used as a package name.

## Adding new packages

Most packages that are available from [Melpa] are also available from
the Emacsmirror.  New packages are added to Melpa on a regular basis
and after a short delay these packages are also semi-automatically
added to the Emacsmirror.  So there is no need to ask for new Melpa
additions to be added to the Emacsmirror too.  It will happen but it
might take a few days.

To get a new package added to the mirror [add it to Melpa][melpa-add]
instead.  That way Melpa users benefit too.

Some packages which have been available from Melpa for a long time are
not available from the Emacsmirror.  See [these lists][not-mirror] and
[these pages](/stats) for the various reasons.
